# Trivy ignore file — every entry MUST have a justification and expiry date.
# When an entry expires, Trivy will start failing again until re-evaluated.
# Format: CVE-ID exp:YYYY-MM-DD # reason
#
# Policy: entries older than 90 days MUST be re-reviewed and either:
#   (a) removed because the runtime image was updated, or
#   (b) renewed with fresh justification
#
# These CVEs are in npm's bundled packages (cross-spawn, glob, minimatch, tar).
# They are part of the npm CLI tool shipped inside node:20-slim.
# RUNTIME CONTEXT: The container entrypoint is `node index.js`.
# npm is NOT invoked at runtime — it is a build/package-management tool only.
# None of these packages are reachable via the application's code paths.
#
# All entries expire 2026-05-20. Re-evaluate when upgrading Node.js base image.

# cross-spawn ReDoS — only exploitable if attacker controls spawn argument strings
# via cross-spawn. npm is not invoked at runtime.
CVE-2024-21538 exp:2026-05-20

# glob command injection — only exploitable if attacker controls glob patterns
# passed to the glob() function. npm is not invoked at runtime.
CVE-2025-64756 exp:2026-05-20

# minimatch ReDoS via repeated wildcards — requires attacker-controlled minimatch
# patterns. npm is not invoked at runtime.
CVE-2026-26996 exp:2026-05-20

# node-tar: arbitrary file overwrite / symlink / path traversal — a chain of 4 CVEs
# in node-tar 6.x (bundled with npm). npm is not invoked at runtime; tar extraction
# from untrusted archives is not performed in the production container.
